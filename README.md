# Welcome to the Design 3 software project of Team 8! (the best one)

The complete project is seperated into 3 independant sub-projects :

1. [Robot](./Robot/)
2. [BaseStation (backend)](./BaseStation/backend/)
3. [BaseStation (frontend)](./BaseStation/frontend/)

For info on how to setup them, please read their `README`.

## Quick setup

If you are on Linux (or Mac?) and use `pyenv`, you can simply `source` the `setup.sh` script.
